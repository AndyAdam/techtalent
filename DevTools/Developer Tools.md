## JavaScript Tools

### Linters
Linters are tools that analyze source code to detect problems based on formatting and code quality rules then output as warnings or errors. They are used to increase code quality, configured manually, and often run automatically when code changes.

* [Eslint](https://eslint.org)
* [Jslint](https://www.jslint.com)
* [JsHint](https://jshint.com/)
  
### Code Formatters
Code formatters are tools to format the codebase automatically based on formatting rules to enforce a consistent coding style. They can behave like linters in term of formatting rules, but can not do anything to help with code quality rules. They can also be integrated into workflows with linters to do both formating and linting in one step.

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/)
  
### Package Managers
Package managers are tools that help you manage packages as dependencies and might also provide a global package registry. They work based on manifest files that keep track application metadata and needed dependencies, lock files to offer deterministic installs.

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [bower](https://bower.io/)
  
### Task Runners  
Task runners are tools to orchestrate repetitive tasks in an efficient way, like concatenating files, minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc., and can be used as standalone or integrated into a more complicated pipeline.

* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
  
### Tranpilers

Transpilers in JavaScript are source-to-source compilers that transform source code in non-JavaScript languages ( CoffeeScript, TypeScript, LiveScript, etc.) or in modern JavaScript versions (ES2015, ES2017, ESNext, etc.) to equivalent JavaScript source code that meets some conditions (browser compatible, minified, strict, etc.)

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)  

### Scarfolding tools
Scaffolding tools allow you to generate projects automatically, also help with upgrading an existing project that has already been generated with the tool, keep it up to date with new best practices, enforce standards, allow for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.
